--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python has been rated by data science and machine learning professionals as their most preferred programming language. As a first step towards to expert voyage, you will learn about Python programming language, especially how it is used in analysis and data science, including the data science pipeline in this course. 

This course also explores how machine learning techniques can be an invaluable tool for solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity - climate change.

At the end of this course, you will work on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format.



In this Stage A, I've made use of dataset which is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and is made available in .csv format on the github link below-
